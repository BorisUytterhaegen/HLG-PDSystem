# HLG-PDSystem
HLG Puredata System: modules, eternals, patches and presets repository

## Random thoughts
1. Every module is functional as a standalone, gui + logic in one patcher.
However, an external GUI module can be connected to its specific address and port. This is a major advantage when you don't want to (or can't) use X-forwarding between devices.
1. Other thought
## Externals
The externals are here in order to have all the necesary ones ready to run any of the patches and abstractions in case this repository is cloned to any of my gear. They have not been written by me and they are only here for the sake of convenience.

## Modules
These are abstractions or subpatchers. They are the building blocks of the HLG Puredata System.
