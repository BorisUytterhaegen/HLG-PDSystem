# HLG-PDSystem
HLG Puredata System: modules, eternals, patches and presets repository 

## Externals
The externals are here in order to have all the necesary ones ready to run any of the patches and abstractions in case this repository is cloned to any of my gear. They have not been written by me and they are only here for the sake of convenience.

## Modules
These are abstractions or subpatchers. They are the building blocks of the HLG Puredata System.
